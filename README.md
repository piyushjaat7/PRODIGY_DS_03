Visualize the decision-making logic of the model

ðŸŒŸ Unique Approach
Converted complex categorical features into meaningful numerical encodings

Visualized the decision tree to explain the modelâ€™s logic to non-technical stakeholders

Highlighted the top features influencing purchasing decisions using feature importance plots

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib / seaborn

Graphviz / dtreeviz (optional for tree visualization)
